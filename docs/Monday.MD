## Project group = Alberto, Dan, Yu Gao - Decision Maker

# Weekend -
built the ERD diagram. drew wireframes of our app. created database schema. discussed basic functionality of app and which componenets handle which tasks. research on drag-and-drop, css libraries, home page, set up routes

# Today -
created new views for polls page and new poll page. updated db schema and seed data. got our routes hooked up and humming along

# Roadblocks -
understanding how all components of existing system fit together took a little time. forgot to include anonymous (boolean) value in ERD

# Wins -
we hooked the DB to a route and got some output. minimum viable product tomorrow maybe.


# %: ( ? )% done
who knows.
